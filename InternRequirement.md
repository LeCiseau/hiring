# Haircurt Mash  

## Brief

You have to create a web interface that compare two haircut side by side and let user decide which one is the coolest (same as [FaceMash
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook#FaceMash))


#### Two web page:
- One for the comparison
- One for the ranking

The ranking is based on points that the haircut's picture win during the comparison

## Constraints

- Pictures have to be fetched by this [API](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeCiseau/Front-end-JSON/master/haircut.json) 
- It can't show same images for side by side comparison
- Haircut picture earn at least 1 point each time it win the comparison
- A picture can be shown again after minimum 3 comparison round

## Not mandatory but greatly appreciated

- Use modern frontend lib (React / Vue)
- Is hosted on a server

- Konami code
- Tougher algorithm
- Beautiful UI
- ...
