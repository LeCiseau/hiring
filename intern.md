# Internship  

### General

The first part consist about a small project, it could be an API or a web interface.
When the first part is validated with our team, we proceed to on-site interview.

Our interviews try to simulate the work you'd do on a day-to-day basis. 
We will not ask for deep algorithm questions, no project in LeCiseau  required to implement complex binary search tree from scratch.

We are also perfectly fine with people that are googling or asking help of their interviewers


### Project Debrief (80 - 120 min)

During this part, interviewer check your code, how you implemented the solution, and the quality of your code.
You will have to defend your code, the challenge here is also to see what is a _good code_ for you, and how you can improve your implementation.


### Simple exercice (5-10 min)

A very small test which can be done in any language. The point here is to see if you can program a simple task in a restricted time and when the constraints are very clear


During the assessment, we will pay attention about how it could be to work with you, mostly it is enjoyable communication
